The Red Hat Certified Specialist in Identity Management exam (EX362) tests your knowledge, skills, and ability to create, configure, and manage Red Hat® Enterprise Linux authentication services and integrate those services with a variety of Red Hat and non-Red Hat products and technologies.

By passing this exam, you become a Red Hat Certified Specialist in Identity Management, which also counts toward becoming a Red Hat® Certified Architect (RHCA®).

This exam is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Red Hat Satellite Server 6, Red Hat Ansible Tower 2, and Microsoft Windows 10 Active Directory. 


You should be able to perform these tasks:

    Install Red Hat Identity Management (IdM) in a scalable, fault-tolerant environment
    Create users/groups/policies
    Install and configure IdM clients
    Configure roaming/automounted home directories
    Use REST apis to query IdM
    Configure Kerberized services
    Create trust relationships with Active Directory
    Configure/control policies and user access
    Configure and manage a certificate authority
    Back up an IdM infrastructure
    Configure IdM as LDAP backend for external services such as Red Hat Satellite Server or Red Hat Ansible Tower
    Implement a SSO

As with all Red Hat performance-based exams, configurations must persist after reboot without intervention.
